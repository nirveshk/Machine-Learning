This is my first git repository. I would like to add all cool stuff and make this page very lively.

Please feel free to give any suggestion and any recommendation as necessary. 

World is beautiful so are you, the only difference between this IT world and me is the knowlwdge I am seeking to absorb, anything related to the IT world. It might seem impossible at the beginning but you will be able to grasp it with the time. However, a strong dedication and consistent practice is necessary to master various coding languages and programs. We will be focusing in teh statistics part for this course. 

Please write codes in a very logical way and in any language you want.
